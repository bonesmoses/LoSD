### BEGIN DAEMON INFO
# Provides:          LoSD
# Short-Description: Monitors and repairs unresponsive phone CDMA radio
# Long-Description:  Some phones have flakey CDMA radios. As such, they will
#                    be unable to stay connected to the carrier's towers. This
#                    daemon will detect these occurrences and attempt to
#                    repair them.
# Version:           1.3.1
# Date:              2012-08-08

 # Clear triggers that detected LoS.
 #
 # If LoS is detected from a system log or some other source, we should reset
 # that value to empty so subsequent detections don't re-detect that error.
 # Otherwise we'll just end up restarting the radio over and over again on
 # the same error. No good!

 #
 # When the script encounters an error, logs are sent to a directory
 # configured at the top of the script. These logs will help determine the
 # cause of the LoS and possibly aid in revising the detection process.
 #
 # Logs are stored in a directory named after a timestamp of the full
 # year, date, and time of the LoS, in YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS format. It is
 # safe to read or remove these logs as the user decides.
